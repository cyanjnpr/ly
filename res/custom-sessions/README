A custom session is just a desktop entry file, like for X11 and Wayland
sessions. For example:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Fish shell
Exec=$PREFIX_DIRECTORY/bin/fish
DesktopNames=null
Terminal=true

The DesktopNames value is optional and sets the XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP and
XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP environment variables. If equal to null or if not present,
XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP and XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP will not be set. Otherwise, the
syntax is the same as described in the Freedesktop Desktop Entry Specification.

The Terminal value specifies if standard output and standard error should be
redirected to the session log file found in Ly's configuration file. If set to
true, Ly will consider the program is going to run in a TTY, and thus will not
redirect standard output & error. It is optional and defaults to false.

Finally, do note that, if the Terminal value is set to true, the
XDG_SESSION_TYPE environment variable will be set to "tty". Otherwise, it will
be set to "unspecified" (without quotes), which is behavior that at least
systemd recognizes (see pam_systemd's man page).
